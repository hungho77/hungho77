# Hi, I'm Ho Thinh Hung 👋

Senior AI Engineer focused on **LLM systems**, **real-time computer vision**, and **GPU-accelerated inference at scale**.  
I design and ship **production-grade AI systems** — from multi-GPU LLM serving to high-throughput, low-latency video analytics.

## 🚀 Selected Projects

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Digital Human Virtual Reception
A WebRTC-based **AI virtual receptionist** delivering sub-second end-to-end latency.

- Designed a **multi-agent architecture** (Perception, Dialogue, Task, Avatar)
- Real-time ASR, emotion detection, speaker diarization over streaming audio
- LLM-driven dialogue with MCP-style planning, tool use, and session memory
- RAG with hybrid retrieval (BM25 + dense) using FAISS / pgvector
- Achieved **~700ms P95 latency** from listen → think → speak in kiosk tests  

**Tech:** LLMs, WebRTC, Kafka, Redis, CUDA, Docker
